# Oh, high there
Computers were a mistake, sand was never meant to think. Growing potatoes would be a better choice.

But I still use them make random stuff:
## Programming
9 years of software development as a job, but I have yet to become at least somewhat decent at it, what a shame.
* Lua in gamedev, back-end and front-end, plugins, etc. Best scripting language, change my mind (you can't)
* Some C and C++, but I'm not good in it
* JS, TS, React, Vue — I have worked with all of that at some point, but like, I still know nothing
* Python — some minor tasks, some plugin scripting, some GUI with Tkinter, PySide, etc...
* Wide range of stuff I worked with at some point, but am not experienced with or have forgotten everything: C#, Go, SQL, MongoDB, Dart+Flutter, Kotlin+Compose, some exotic stuff, such as QuakeC, LSL and CSound.

My favorite topics that I actually like to work on (but usually don't get to) are language learning software, sound synthesis and music software, games and random things that didn't exist when I needed them (see below).

### My FOSS projects (ones that actually make sense and have users):
* [Route finder for the game Vintage Story](https://translocator.moe/). Made me remember how Dijkstra algorithm and quad trees work.
* [GNOME extension that allows me to switch between 4 language inputs with separate shortcuts for each language, because cycling between them is not good](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6547/input-source-d-bus-interface/)

## Music
Videogame-ish stuff. Have written music for my friend's game that only like 5 people have ever played. One day I'll update this section.

## 3D modelling in Blender
I like it a lot, it seems like a dream job that I'll never have. For now I'm mostly making static meshes for Second Life.
